Scooter Framework
=================

----------
What is it
----------
This is an unreleased version of the latest Scooter Framework source code. 
Please notice that this version of Scooter is significantly different from the 
released version posted on http://www.scooterframework.com/". But this is a much better one.

--------------------
How to create an app
--------------------
Creating an app is much easier with this version. Just one command:
>java -jar tools/create.jar blog

The blog application will be created under the webapps directory. 
You can create as many applications as you want. 
They will be all created under the same webapps directory.

Use -help option to get more options.

------------
How to build
------------
1. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a JDK installation.
2. Type 'ant build' to create a scooter.jar

Type 'ant' to get a list of targets

-----------------
How to run an app
-----------------
>java -jar tools/server.jar blog 9090

--------------------------
Can I run my archived apps
--------------------------
Yes. You can move the created app, e.g. blog from webapps to a different directory, such as myapps directory.
>java -Dwebapps.name=myapps -jar tools/server.jar blog

This -Dwebapps.name option is very useful when you upgrade scooter framework for your existing apps.
