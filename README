Scooter Framework
=================

What is it
----------

This is an unreleased version of the latest Scooter Framework source code. Please notice that this version of Scooter is significantly different from the released version posted on <a href="http://www.scooterframework.com/">Scooter Framework website</a>. But it is a much better one.

How to build
------------
1. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a JDK installation.
2. Type 'ant' to get a list of targets
3. Type 'ant build' to create a scooter.jar

How to create an app
--------------------
Creating an app is much easier with this version. Just one command:

>java -jar tools/create.jar blog

The blog application will be created under the webapps directory. You can create as many applications as you want. They will be all created under the same webapps directory.

Use -help option to get more options.

How to run an app
-----------------

>java -jar tools/server.jar blog 9090

1. Recreate tools/generate.jar for this version.
2. Recreate tools/generate-signon.jar for this version.
