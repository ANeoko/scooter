<h2>How to build</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Set JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a JDK installation.</li>
  <li>Type 'ant' to get a list of targets</li>
  <li>Type 'ant build' to create a scooter.jar</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to create an app</h2>
<p>Creating an app is much easier with this version. Just one command:</p>
